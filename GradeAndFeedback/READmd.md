# Thank you for your submission, Sam!

You've taken onboard a fantastic amount of learning this week and have managed to bring your knowledge together in creating this app! Bringing all the knew knowledge about React and applying it is not easy, well done!

## HTML (JSX)

Your HTML (JSX) is clear and well structured. This is an excellent foundation for styling, accessibility and JS interactivity, and makes future changes nice and straightforward! All images have relevant alt text. Its easy to lose track of semantics with React so try to keep them in mind.

## CSS

Your styling is fantastic, clear and matches the wireframe! You have even taken a massive step and gotten your feet wet with tailwind! Your site is nicely responsive and images look great when displayed in the main image container! There are some bits we can improve on, lets take a look.

Its easy to get confused and overwrite different styles so its important to have a plan and stick to it. You can use a combination of Global CSS, separate css pages, css modules and tailwind css to style your page just be warned that its easier to get styling errors and to be careful of [specificity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_cascade/Specificity).

## JavaScript React/Structure

Great use of functions, conditionals, loops and operators! You have correctly and effectively used both useState and useEffect. You have correctly used .map to render elements to the page and provided keys where necessary! You have also Included basic keyboard navigation! You have also separated your code out into different components!

## Reflection

Thank you for submitting a great reflection! As always, your reflection is an essential resource for me to be able to give you some specific feedback on your conceptual understanding! Keep it up!!!

## Grade

This is a great first step into React! You have done fantastically and should feel proud of what you've created! Changing to React is not easy and you have done fantastically here! Putting in extra effort top have it be visually pleasing and to track focus changing in the thumbnails!!!
